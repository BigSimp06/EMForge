MailCraftsmen Guide 

MailCraftsmen is a tool used for creating combinations of emails from the first and last name of the user. 

Prequisits:
- Python 3.11 
- a wordlist of names 

Wordlist layout:

The way that this program will read from the file and you will need to seperate the first and last name with a space, this means that the words shouldnt have a space before hand. 

For an example take a look at the example wordlist. 

For this you will also need the email domain, for instance if you are looking for emails on hotmail.com, you would need to enter hotmail.com when the domain is queried. 

This tool also works for a single name and will be upgraded for better functionality. 

Thank you!
